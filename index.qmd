# Sharing R tipps, gaining confidence


### 1.  **Develop a community**

Who's using R at LJMU? Who is has recently come across an exciting new package, learnt a new R skill, or is a pro at something R-related that may be useful for the rest of us? 

Our R user Group hopefully helps curate a network!

In addition - and that's more aimed at the PGR participants - here's your opportunity to gain experience in teaching/presenting! It's short, it's hands-on, it can go on your CV.
      

### 2.  **Build confidence**

Present your skills, and share your practice! 
      

### 3.  **Learn new skills**

Learn about R packages that are probably not used in your discipline - who knows what they might be useful for!
     

### Why this page?

Because we need a space to host and share. And it's been made in R Studio, so has relevance!
