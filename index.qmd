NMFS Openscapes is a multi-year collaboration between NOAA Fisheries and [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) to promote a data-driven culture through the adoption of open science tools and strategies. Openscapes provides team-based training in reproducible scientific workflows, data management, coding, and optimal team collaboration and project management. We have had 10 Openscapes Champions cohorts in 2020-2024 (500+ staff! \[40 staff per cohort\]) involving all six science centers plus two regional offices, and support local data science mentors mentors at each center and office. 

## NMFS Openscapes 3-year Framework and FY24 plan

As part of the NOAA Fisheries Data Modernization Strategy, we work with all six NMFS science centers, five regional offices, and the Office of Science and Technology. We have three synergistic objectives:

1.  **Develop a mentor community**. We will develop a community of mentors across NMFS centers/offices. With Openscapes facilitation these mentors will learn and work together to strengthen Open Science skills (e.g. code and data-sharing and project management) at their center/office, co-create reusable resources for NMFS-specific scientific products, and collaborate with their colleagues via local activities and trainings.
2.  **Empower scientific teams**. We will support center/office researchers to become high-functioning teams as they transition to Open Science and reproducible scientific workflows through the Openscapes' Champions and Pathways to Open Science programs and other Community Skill Building Workshops. Cohorts can include teams from the same or across centers/offices, or be topic specific (like stock assessment reports) to strengthen relationships and shared practices.
3.  **Amplify Open Science leaders**. We will amplify NMFS Open Science leaders and leverage synergistic efforts within NMFS and NOAA. We will focus on opportunities and recognition for staff who support their colleagues, which is critical to upskilling the NMFS workforce, deepening leadership capacity within NOAA, and connecting to the global Open Science movement.

## What is the impact of this?

What does shifting to open science look like across a federal agency like NOAA, and what are the impacts to the efficiency and quality of their scientific products as teams work to reduce silo-ing and duplication of effort? NOAA Fisheries colleagues shared their experiences via a conference presentation on the Year of Open Science:
