### OPEN SESSION

Nothing in particular planned for this session - but please still come along to have a chat about old resources, new things you've found, or an R problem that's bugging you.  This will take place  1-2pm on Wednesday November 19th in Byrom Street JP 3.18 [IT room].

   
### Resources

If we're discussing anything share-worthy, this will be provided here.
In the interim, some adverting for anyone interested: The R consortium is organising a reasonably priced online conference on R+AI this November. If you're free Nov 12/13th 2015, check it out and register here: [R+AI](https://rconsortium.github.io/RplusAI_website/)
