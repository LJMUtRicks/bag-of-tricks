### Open Research Workshop Series

We're excited to invite you to a short series of in-person practical workshops at Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU) focused on improving reproducibility, research collaboration, and data management. These sessions are open to all disciplines, including Science, Engineering and beyond, and are designed to be hands-on, accessible, and directly relevant to your work.

#### Workshop Schedule
