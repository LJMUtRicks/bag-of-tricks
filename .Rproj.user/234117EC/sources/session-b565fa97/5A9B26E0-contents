### Open Research: GitHub for R users

We're excited to invite you to a hands on session in one of LJMU's IT rooms, to finally get your Git / GitHub journey started, and facilitate version control. Join us on September 17th, 1-2pm in Byrom Street room 3.18.

This session is lead by **Felix Zajitschek**: What is Git/Github, and how do I use it with R? 

   
### Resources

#### The hands-on course

To facilitate self-guided learning for those who weren't able to come in person, Felix has created a website/course (in GitHub!) to follow along: 
        
[zajitschek.github.io/git_workshop_LJMU_2025](https://zajitschek.github.io/git_workshop_LJMU_2025/) 


*Addendum to the course, for LJMU managed PCs:*    
Please note that there may be slight differences on different LJMU managed machines (some still have the APP players, others only the COMPANY PORTAL). 
For the Git tab to be showing in your R Studio environment on you managed computer, youâ€™ll need to install Git (or Git GUI) and restart your R Studio.
     
    
*Please get in touch with feedback / questions, and/or requests to do a repeat or follow up of this, either in person or online.*
