It is a way to work together that shifts culture by helping people find each other and collaboratively evolve their work with modern and kind open data science workflows. Openscapes launched in 2018 through funding from Mozilla, via an open science fellowship awarded to Julie Lowndes. Openscapes grew with funding from NASA Earthdata, via decades-long community building leadership by Erin Robinson. In addition to our flagship Champions program that helps science teams shift workflows to open science, we lead multi-year projects with NASA and NOAA. Our NASA work supports scientific researchers using data from NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud; our NOAA work is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act funds to support NOAA Fisheries’ data, infrastructure, and workforce modernization. We were recently recognized by The White House for our movement building in open science."

The Openscapes Flywheel builds momentum as a culture change engine as We engage a Future Us mindset through welcoming and creating space and place, we Empower a learning culture by investing in learning and trust, and working openly, and we amplify open leaders by leveraging common open data science workflows, skills and tools and inspire broader scientific culture change.

The plan is to share I all resources here (and on the internal sharepoint site, it remains to be seen which of the two you find more useful!).\nIf you’re at LJMU and not yet part of the group, please get in touch and I’ll add you. Obviously anyone from anywhere is welcome to browse our pool of resources on this github page, we hope you find it useful! :-)\nAs this is pretty new still, I would be grateful for suggestions and feedback, and would be particularly grateful for help with leading a session! “Presentations” may be as short as 10mins, just giving an overview of what you’re sharing, and showing a worked example. The remaining time people can try to get this to work for themselves, with associated R markdown scripts shared here.\nWe might also have occasional “clinics” where you bring and discuss your analysis/stats/plot problem and the community can help you find solutions - apologies that this is not very inclusive for our online-online participants! But I will be sharing useful resources as we go along and as they’re discovered.",
