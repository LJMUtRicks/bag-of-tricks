    "text": "Openscapes is an open source approach and a movement. It is a way to work together that shifts culture by helping people find each other and collaboratively evolve their work with modern and kind open data science workflows. Openscapes launched in 2018 through funding from Mozilla, via an open science fellowship awarded to Julie Lowndes. Openscapes grew with funding from NASA Earthdata, via decades-long community building leadership by Erin Robinson. In addition to our flagship Champions program that helps science teams shift workflows to open science, we lead multi-year projects with NASA and NOAA. Our NASA work supports scientific researchers using data from NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud; our NOAA work is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act funds to support NOAA Fisheries’ data, infrastructure, and workforce modernization. We were recently recognized by The White House for our movement building in open science."

We do this through our flagship Champions mentorship program, as well as through community organizing, training, and coaching, leveraging existing resources from open communities along with our own.\nOur flywheel shows our approach to engaging, empowering, and amplifying research communities in open data science — how we describe kinder, better science in less time.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 from Robinson & Lowndes 2022. The Openscapes Flywheel builds momentum as a culture change engine as We engage a Future Us mindset through welcoming and creating space and place, we Empower a learning culture by investing in learning and trust, and working openly, and we amplify open leaders by leveraging common open data science workflows, skills and tools and inspire broader scientific culture change. And the Flywheel turns again."
